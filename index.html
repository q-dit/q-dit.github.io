            Recent advancements in diffusion models, particularly the architectural transformation from UNet-based models to Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), significantly improve the quality and scalability of image/video generation. 
            However, despite their impressive capabilities, the substantial computational costs of these large-scale models pose significant challenges for real-world deployment.
            Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) emerges as a promising solution, enabling model compression and accelerated inference for pretrained models, without the costly retraining.
            However, research on DiT quantization remains sparse, and existing PTQ frameworks, primarily designed for traditional diffusion models, tend to suffer from biased quantization, leading to notable performance degradation.
            In this work, we identify that DiTs typically exhibit significant spatial variance in both weights and activations, along with temporal variance in activations.
            To address these issues, we propose Q-DiT, a novel approach that seamlessly integrates two key techniques: automatic quantization granularity allocation to handle the significant variance across input channels of weights and activations, and dynamic activation quantization to adaptively capture activation changes across timesteps.
            Extensive experiments conducted on ImageNet and VBench demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Q-DiT.
            Specifically, when quantizing DiT-XL/2 to W6A8 on ImageNet $256 \times 256$, Q-DiT achieves a remarkable reduction in FID by 1.09 compared to the baseline. 
            Under the W4A8 setting, it maintains high fidelity in image and video generation, establishing a new benchmark for efficient, high-quality quantization in DiTs.

            The weights and activations within each layer are quantized with the same group size. 
            Group size configurations allocated for each layer are based on the evolutionary search results, which are guided by the FID/FVD score between the real samples and samples generated by the quantized model. 
            The activations are dynamically quantized during runtime.

            A vibrant scene of a snowy mountain landscape. 
            The sky is filled with a multitude of colorful hot air balloons, each floating at different heights, creating a dynamic and lively atmosphere. 
            The balloons are scattered across the sky, some closer to the viewer, others further away, adding depth to the scene.  
            Below, the mountainous terrain is blanketed in a thick layer of snow, with a few patches of bare earth visible here and there. 
            The snow-covered mountains provide a stark contrast to the colorful balloons, enhancing the visual appeal of the scene.  
            In the foreground, a few cars can be seen driving along a winding road that cuts through the mountains. 
            The cars are small compared to the vastness of the landscape, emphasizing the grandeur of the surroundings.  
            The overall style of the video is a mix of adventure and tranquility, with the hot air balloons adding a touch of whimsy to the otherwise serene mountain landscape. 
            The video is likely shot during the day, as the lighting is bright and even, casting soft shadows on the snow-covered mountains.
